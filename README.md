#ScreenTap 
###### A simple screenshot grabber, yet powerful.

The program will continue to grab a screenshot every `x seconds` and upload it to a firebase cloud database.

The program can easily be converted into an `exe` either with `nuitka`, `pyinstaller` or with `cz_freeze`

To stop the program remotely, simply add a random image with name as `stop_screentap.jpeg` to the project folder and run the script `stopper.py`.


##Requirements:
`pip install pillow`

`pip install pyscreenshot`
